This repository serves as my personal workspace where I apply the knowledge gained during my Frontend training (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to practical exercises, including side projects and individual experiments beyond my assigned homework.

My goal is to reinforce every topic I learn through small, working examples and to develop larger projects over time.
